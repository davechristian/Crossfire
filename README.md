# Crossfire
This is a tiny game I created over a few evenings for PyWeek - a Python game jam. The idea is that you control two ships at once using the cursor keys, and use z and x keys to fire. The theme of the game jam was '9 Times', and so the player has 9 sections of health, 9 bullets on screen at a time, gfx uses a palette of 9 colours... you get the idea.

I have uploaded it in the hope that it may be useful to anyone learning PyGame, although please bear in mind that this was written in a rush over a few evenings, while I was first learning Python, so it's hardly polished best practice reference code!

The only library required is PyGame. I have tested the game with Python 3.8.5 and PyGame 1.9.6 and 2.0.1 recently, so I know those versions will work.

The game is released under the MIT license so you can pretty much do what you like with it. If you do find it useful then please drop me a line (@davejchr on the tweety app), I'd love to see what parts of the code were useful.

The script to run is 'CrossFire.py'.

Have fun, happy blasting :)
